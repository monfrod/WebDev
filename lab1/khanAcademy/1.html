        <h2>The Lost Song â€“ The Cat Empire</h2>
         <h3>I had nine lives but I lost all of  them <br>
And I've been searching in the night and I've been searching in the rain <br>
I tried to find them, but they disappeared<br>
They walked away they dressed in black they left my side and all I say<br>
Is that I wasted time when I looked for them<br>
For now I know that things gone past are never to be found again<br>
No never never again<br>
I had nine lives, but lost all of them</h3>
